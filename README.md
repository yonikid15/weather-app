# Weather App

# TO DO

- Find photos of cities ( hopefully ), or settle for images of weather 
  - maybe a gradiant background color ( red = hot, blue = cold )?
  - google place photos might be free

- Add a map! When page opens, move logo to top left corner, then open map like an old television ( center zoom? )
